      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        Our platform allows citizens to easily schedule appointments for various

        workers can also utilize our system to efficiently manage appointments
        for their clients. Here's how it works:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Citizens or corporate workers visit our website and select the desired
          government service.
        </li>
        <li>
          They choose a convenient date and time slot from the available
          options.
        </li>
        <li>
          They provide necessary personal or client information and confirm the
          appointment.
        </li>
        <li>
          An automated confirmation email or SMS is sent with appointment
          details.
        </li>
        <li>
          On the scheduled date, they arrive at the government office with the
          necessary documents, bypassing long queues and saving time.
